# Notes on Unlayer
- It seems pretty good, we can load existing designs (e.g. if a communication is a draft), we must save the entire JSON object which includes the HTML
- We can have light and dark mode, custom tools and have the toolbar on left and right

## Things we have to pay for

- Social media tool
- Timer tool
- Video tool
- User upload image tab, this would save all the images uploaded by a user (we'd have to store user information)
- Font management to add custom fonts to the editor
- Custom JS/CSS to allow us to customise the editor
