# Unlayer Email Drag and Drop

## Notes

- It seems pretty good, we can load existing designs (e.g. if a communication is a draft), we must save the entire JSON object which includes the HTML
- The HTML alone if put into a seperate file will show all features as designed so marketting will only require this section
- We can have light and dark mode, custom tools and have the toolbar on left and right
- I had a conversation with an advisor at Unlayer about Pauloâ€™s question regarding whether we can have access to some of their pre-built templates. He said that we would be able to purchase up to 20 of their pre-built templates for $5 each, if we are on one of their paid plans.

- He also said that they offer a 14-day free trial of the paid plan if we wanted to try out some of the paid for features.

- A user can have UNLIMITED User Blocks for free!

### Things we have to pay for

- If we want more than ONE Custom Block
- Social media tool https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/social-media-tool
- Timer tool https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/timer
- Video tool https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/video-tool
- User upload image tab, this would save all the images uploaded by a user (we'd have to store user information) https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/user-uploads
- Font management to add custom fonts to the editor https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/font-management
- Custom JS/CSS to allow us to customise the editor https://docs.unlayer.com/docs/custom-js-css
